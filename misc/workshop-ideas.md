# Workshop ideas

### Mini-world

Make a one-screen puzzle-like interactive scenario that introduces the player to a visually unique and consistent world. These are the requirements:

* It has to contain at least 4 interactive objects or areas

* It has to be "solved" by a sequence of at least 3 mouse interactions, i.e. clicking things in the right sequence, clicking at the right moment, dragging and dropping.

### Locative games

Mashing the GeoLocation API (native to your browser) with Phaser or Twine (or both!)

### Social interfaces

What happens when your body is the controller? When you turn a single-player game into a multi-player one?

Examples: [Bounden](http://playbounden.com), [JS Joust](http://jsjoust.com)

Using Kinect + Scratch (and/or webcam + [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)) hack a game and take it *out of the screen*. We’ll show you some examples and demonstrate a few tricks, then it’s up to you to make your own.


### Story-line ice-breaker

1. Line people up on one side of the room. 

* On the other side is the *story line*. 

* One person at a time moves to the story line and says their story line. 

* The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time*) or the end of the story (eg: *And since then, everyone revered Joe*). 

* Everyone can take their spot in between the beginning and the end. 

* Every time someone joins the line, the story loops from the beginning.
