# Story-line ice-breaker

1. Line people up on one side of the room. 

* On the other side is the *story line*. 

* One person at a time moves to the story line and says their story line. 

* The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time*) or the end of the story (eg: *And since then, everyone revered Joe*). 

* Everyone can take their spot in between the beginning and the end. 

* Every time someone joins the line, the story loops from the beginning.
