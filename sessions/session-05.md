# Session 5

### Today, Thursday 14th May 

* Present game ideas
* [Sort out Git repo](#sort-out-git-repo)
* Running a web server
* Phaser again

# Sort out Git repo

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Go to [github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Interactive-Narratives](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Interactive-Narratives)
* [**Fork**](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Interactive-Narratives#fork-destination-box) it
* Copy the *HTTPS clone URL* from your new fork, should look something like `https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Interactive-Narratives.git`
* Open the [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) app
* `File > New / Clone` or `cmd + N`
* `Clone from URL`
	* Paste your *HTTPS clone URL* in the `Source URL`
	* The `Destination Path` should be an *empty* folder on your computer
	* The `Name` can be whatever you want
*	Press `Clone`
*	Once the repository is cloned and downloaded, SourceTree will open up a new window for the repo.

You will push your code to your forked repo, not to the original repo.

### To get the latest files from the original repo

1.	Click on `Settings` (the cog icon on the top-right corner)
* `Remotes` > `Add`
	* `Remote name` can be whatever you want, the convention is to call it `upstream`
	* `URL / path` is `https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Interactive-Narratives.git`, which is the *HTTPS clone URL* of the original repo
* When `upstream` is added to your SourceTree left sidebar, you can right-click on it and choose `Pull from upstream...`
* This will pull (download) all the latest files from the original repository into your fork.	 		


# Phaser again :)



# Homework?

Decide on one game idea, research tech (we suggest Phaser)

# Story-line ice-breaker

1. Line people up on one side of the room. 

* On the other side is the *story line*. 

* One person at a time moves to the story line and says their story line. 

* The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time*) or the end of the story (eg: *And since then, everyone revered Joe*). 

* Everyone can take their spot in between the beginning and the end. 

* Every time someone joins the line, the story loops from the beginning.
