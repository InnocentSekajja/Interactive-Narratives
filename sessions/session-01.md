# Hacking games with verbs

Whether it is running or collecting, shooting or trading, games are driven by **verbs**. 

In this workshop we pick out the verbs that make up a game and explore how these verbs express certain **messages** and **morals**. 

Then we **hack** the game with new verbs, so that it communicates our own messages and morals.

> old game + alternative narrative / mechanics = new game

### Games vs stories

**Brainstorm** definitions of games, stories, what they have in common and what they don’t have in common.

**Ludology vs Narratology **

*If I throw a ball at you, I don’t expect you to drop it and wait until it starts telling stories*

Markku Eskelinen

Interactive media (*cybertexts*, games) are different to linear media (books, film, comics). 

Eskelinen explains such differences in the *[gaming situatio*n](http://www.gamestudies.org/0101/eskelinen)

1. **Interpretation** (shared with linear media)

    1. What’s happening?

    2. What does it mean?

    3. How do I feel about it?

    4. What does the author want to convey?

2. **Exploration**

    5. Interactive like a banana?

    6. Non trivial actions (such as turning or scrolling a page) are required to reveal hidden content

3. **Formation of goals**

    7. What do I have to do to win?

    8. What I’m expected to do?

    9. How can I cheat/break the game/find the limits of the system?

4. **Recombination**Players reconfigure the internal state of a game according to predefined rules. (Tetris)

5. **Creation of new content**A more extreme case of recombination in which the players modify content and mechanics or create their own (Minecraft)

6. **Agency**The satisfying power to take meaningful action and see the results of our decisions and choices. Can there be a game without agency?

7. **[Simulation versus Representatio**n](http://www.ludology.org/articles/sim1/simulation101.html)

**Games as story generators**

The output of a **simulation** might look the same as a **representation** (story, video…) but the **experience** of playing is very different.

To summarize: ludologists claim that it’s not possible to fully understand games and simulations by analyzing their linear output. Narrativist theories coming from literature, film, theater and other linear media fields must be combined with conceptual tools from cybernetics (the study of systems that involve closed loops, aka feedback)
