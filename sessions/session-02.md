Before videogames…

* Gamebooks (aka Choose Your Own Adventure)

* Dada poems**_To make a Dadaist poem_**

    * *Take a newspaper.*

    * *Take a pair of scissors.*

    * *Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.*

    * *Cut out the article.*

    * *Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.*

    * *Shake it gently.*

    * *Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.*

    * *Copy conscientiously.*

    * *The poem will be like you.*

    * *And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.– Tristan Tzara, 1920*

* Jorge Luis Borges**The Garden of Forking Paths (1941)**In the short story a character named Ts’ui Pên tells everybody that he wanted to write a book and build a labyrinth. Nobody ever found the labyrinth, only a very confusing and contradictory book. We then discover that the book *is* the labyrinth. In the fictional book, every chapter is followed by "every" possible continuation.

* Agusto Boal’s **Forum Theatre** (1960)

* **Hopscotch** by Julio Cortázar (1963)

* **Raymond Queneau** 

* **HYPERTEXT** Ted Nelson coined the term Hypertext in the 60s. A system of non-sequential writing that would allow the reader to aggregate meaning in snippets, in the order of his or her choosing, rather than according to a pre-established structure fixed by the author.The concept of hypertext is now familiar to anybody thanks to the World Wide Web (invented in 1990 and popularized in 1995 with the invention of modern browsers) but in the 80s it was a quite exotic medium, especially for non-utilitarian uses.Still some fiction writers started to experiment with the hypertext as literary form.Examples: [Afternoon](http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/pmaf/hypertext/aft/index.html) and [253](http://www.ryman-novel.com/)

### WORKSHOP: Twine (individual)

Creating branching narratives with [Twine](http://twinery.org) (download app or use the [online editor](http://twinery.org/2)), an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.

Great examples of interactive narratives made with Twine:

* [Ultra business tycoon III](http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/tycoon/crime.html)

* more [games by Porpentine](http://aliendovecote.com/hypertext.html)

More sophisticated tools worth mentioning:

* [Undum](http://undum.com/) (allows for more variables/states)

* [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) it’s a whole different way to conceive programming (using natural language)

Tutorial on how Twine works (see [this video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/5010370) and the following from that guy), then..

Write a branching story with one or more of the following features:

* Non-human main character

* Events out of chronological order

* Multiple characters

Write the first paragraph and (at least) a couple of examples of choices.

Illustrations / images / animations are a bonus.

### Homework (individual)

Write (and illustrate) your story using Twine.

Upload it to your personal web space and post a link in the blog.

Try to limit each block of text to one or two paragraphs

Don’t provide many choices, provide interesting choices

Don’t just think about the content, think about how it could be narrated:

* spatial? metaphysical? puzzle?

* self-aware / self referential?

* first, second, third person?

* multiple endings? multiple beginnings?

* Do you control an avatar?

* Does it have graphics? What’s the relation between graphics and text?
