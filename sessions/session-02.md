# Session 2 

### Today, 23rd April 

1. Board games 
2. Home-play debate
3. Branching narratives with Twine



# Board games

We'll play *critically* two popular board games

1. Monopoly 
2. Settlers of Catan

Your tasks

* Write down what you're doing and how you're feeling
* What activities in life does the game simulate?
* List 5 areas of your life that could be games. Then briefly describe a possible underlying game structure for each.
* Think of things you enjoyed as a child.
* List 10 games you played as a child. What was compelling about those games?

Player experience goals

Core mechanic

Videos - Big Bang Theory, Tutorial



# Home-play debate

Present the story-game you [played and analysed](sessions/session-01.md#assignment).

1. Pitch your story-game in one sentence. You want to convince us to play it! 
2. On a scale from `0` (no game - only story) to `10` (no story - only game), where would you place your story-game and why?

### Analysis framework

Consider your story-game as a system of **narrative representation**. 

* What is the **situation**? What are the *events* that happen in your story-game?
* Who are the **characters** and what are their *goals*?
* How is the story delivered?
	* Which narrative elements are **embedded** (pre-generated parts of the story, eg: scripted scenes)?
	* Which narrative elements are **emergent** (created on-the-fly as you play)?
	* What is the *balance* between embedded and emergent narratives?
* What **conflicts** are there, between players or between player and the game system? 
* How is the game creating **uncertainty** to fuel tension and keep you hooked?
* What role does the **setting** play?
* What about the **visual design**?

<!--#### Cybernetics

Find at least one **feedback loop** that contributes to the overall system of the game. Identify the sensor, comparator and actuator in the loop.

* Is it a positive or negative loop?
* How does the feedback loop affect the overall gameplay experience?
* What would happen if it were taken out of the game?
* How could the rules be changed to exaggerate the effects of the feedback loop?
* What is a different feedback loop that may improve the game?

#### Social interaction

* Is there *forbidden play* (can you cheat, and how does the game react to it)?
* What's your role as a player?-->



# Branching narratives

> If I throw a ball at you, I don’t expect you to drop it and wait until it starts telling stories

[Markku Eskelinen](http://www.gamestudies.org/0101/eskelinen)

<!--Let's **brainstorm** concepts related to games, stories, what they have in common and what they don't have in common.-->


Before videogames...

* **Dada** poems		>	**To make a Dadaist poem**
	
	> 1. Take a newspaper.
	> * Take a pair of scissors.
	> * Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.
	> * Cut out the article.
	> * Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.
	> * Shake it gently.
	> * Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.
	> * Copy conscientiously.
	> * The poem will be like you.
	> * And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.		[Tristan Tzara, 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Tzara)

* Jorge Luis Borges **[The Garden of Forking Paths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths)** (1941)		In the short story a character named Ts'ui Pên tells everybody that he wanted to write a book and build a labyrinth. Nobody ever found the labyrinth, only a very confusing and contradictory book. We then discover that the book *is* the labyrinth. In the fictional book, every chapter is followed by "every" possible continuation.

* Raymond Queneau **[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems](http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauRandom_v4.html)** (1961)

	Derived from a set of ten basic sonnets, they are printed on card with **each line on a separated strip**, like a heads-bodies-and-legs book. All ten sonnets have the same rhyme scheme and employ the same rhyme sounds. As a result, any line from a sonnet can be combined with any from the other nine, giving 1014 (= 100,000,000,000,000) different poems. Working twenty-four hours a day, it would you take some 140,000,000 years to read them all.

* [Gamebooks](http://samizdat.cc/cyoa), aka *Choose Your Own Adventure* in the 1970s and 80s

	[![](assets/ufo-acorn-nodes.png)](http://samizdat.cc/cyoa)

* **HyperText** is a word [Ted Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) coined in the 60s. 

	> A system of **non-sequential writing** that would allow the reader to aggregate meaning in snippets, in the order of his or her choosing, rather than according to a pre-established structure fixed by the author.
		We're now familiar with hypertext because of the World Wide Web (invented in 1989) but in the 80s it was quite a weird thing, with a literary potential.
<!--Examples: [Afternoon](http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/pmaf/hypertext/aft/index.html) and [253](http://www.ryman-novel.com/)-->* Text Adventures, such as [ZORK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), were massively popular in the 80s.

# Twine

Creating branching narratives with [Twine](http://twinery.org) (download app or use the [online editor](http://twinery.org/2)), an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.

Great examples of interactive narratives made with Twine:

* [Ultra business tycoon III](http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/tycoon/crime.html)

* more [games by Porpentine](http://aliendovecote.com/hypertext.html)

More sophisticated tools worth mentioning:

* [Undum](http://undum.com/) (allows for more variables/states)

* [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) it's a whole different way to conceive programming (using natural language)

Tutorial on how Twine works (see [this video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/5010370) and the following from that guy), then..

Write a branching story with one or more of the following features:

* Non-human main character

* Events out of chronological order

* Multiple characters

Write the first paragraph and (at least) a couple of examples of choices.

Illustrations / images / animations are a bonus.

# Assignment

Write (and illustrate) your story using Twine.

Upload it to your personal web space and post a link in the blog.

Try to limit each block of text to one or two paragraphs.

Don't provide many choices, provide interesting choices

Don't just think about the content, think about how it could be narrated:

* spatial? metaphysical? puzzle?
* self-aware / self referential?
* first, second, third person?
* multiple endings? multiple beginnings?
* Do you control an avatar?
* Does it have graphics? 
* What's the relation between graphics and text?
