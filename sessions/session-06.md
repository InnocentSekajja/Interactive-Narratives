# Homework

Using Phaser (or similar) *remix* an exploration-based game so that it tells **your** [non]linear story though space. The work may have one or more of the following features:

* Broken time-space continuum

* Non stereotypical kind of fantasy. Can you imagine a fantasy world that is not derived from Tolkien, Asimov, Disney?

* Autobiographical (not necessarily a realistic contemporary setting)

* Based in the Greenwich Peninsula (at any point in history)
