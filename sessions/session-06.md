### Spy-stories

Enhancing linear narratives with game-like activities and puzzles. 

Case study: digital making workshop for Children's BBC based around the TV series MI High (a spy show for kids) - it combined specially filmed videos with the actors, with a hands-on coding workshop to create an interactive drama.

Conceptualise and hack together a puzzle mini-game that complements your main story (eg: 310515.com) and reveals / unlocks parts of the story. 

#### Mini-world (individual)

Make a one-screen puzzle-like interactive scenario that introduces the player to a visually unique and consistent world. These are the requirements:

* It has to contain at least 4 interactive objects or areas

* It has to be "solved" by a sequence of at least 3 mouse interactions, i.e. clicking things in the right sequence, clicking at the right moment, dragging and dropping.

### Homework? (individual)

Finish your mini-game
