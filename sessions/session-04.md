### Themis

> Mime something you like to do :)

Likes maths and riddles. Studied mechanical engineering, worked in a fabric-dying factory. Then become a trader, then a teacher.

Two goals in life:

> 1. Create my own business
> 2. I want to help young people develop skills to realise their potential and dreams



# Educational games and activities

### [Mission water cycle](http://www.flowathens.com/en/project/23)

![](http://www.flowathens.com/uploads/photos/7q7emarathon%20for%20flow%20-%2008.jpg)

* **Adventure locative game** for children 10-13
* Based around the Marathon Dam, built in 1930s
* Commissioned by the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP)
* Players are *planet agents*
* Mission to save the water cycle
* Riddles to solve at each *station*, to collect water coins
* Collaborative game: teams play against *time*, everybody wins
* Learning how to save water, treat water, fix leaks, built an aqueduct
* [Experiential learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning)
* Teaming up with storytellers to come up with a concept that  ties together **mini-games**
* Incremental rewards

### [All for one](http://www.flowathens.com/en/project/16)

![](http://www.flowathens.com/uploads/photos/Bd2I_MG_1377.jpg)

* Brief: simple physical game, low budget, about disabilities
* Collaborative game: can't win it by yourself
* Manoeuvring a water bottle tied to 3 ropes to hit objects and collect points. 
* Three players control one end of the rope each
* First playtesting: just one bottle, three ropes and some objects to tilt 
* Second playtesting: introducing colours and a rudimentary hoist system (with trees)
* Third playtesting: blindfolded players, only one can see and direct the others
* Inverted pyramid idea: inspired by 3D printers


### [Fun theory](http://www.thefuntheory.com)

![](http://cmuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/piano-stairs-stockholm-sweden.jpg)

Turning mundane tasks into playful, fun activities.

Can you change people's behaviours through games?

### [Bounden](http://bounden.gameovenstudios.com)

![](http://bounden.gameovenstudios.com/images/BoundenPlayed3.jpg)

By playing the game people do something else (eg learn to dance)

### [X-treasure hunts](http://xtreasurehunts.com/Pages/021_TreasureHunts_EN.html)

* Stealth treasure hunt in the library
* Walking tours around the Acropolis
* Week-long sailing game
* Hide and seek at Ikea

### [Hear us Here](http://www.hearushereapp.com)

Location and object based storytelling platform.

Sounds and events are triggered based on where you go.

# Questions

* How did `the game designer` **solve** this?
* What were the **challenges**?
* How would you approach this?
* What are **transferable skills** from a project to another?

# Food for thought

* Physical collaboration: each player becomes part of a system

> A machine made by people

* Change the **scale** of a game

* Combine concepts/mechanics from different games

* Transfer ideas from board games, from street games, from video games

* Tiny tasks to reach a  bigger goal

* Limit movements of a player

* Multiple players controlling the same characters

* Find a concept that makes the playing experience meaningful



# Play-taste

* Inspiration: tasting experiences
* Ingredients: try with simple materials
* Play-test each idea


* **Thumb Wars** - to experience a few quick iterations of {idea / prototype / playtesting / evaluation} development cycles.

* **Basecamp** - We will discuss how the game idea gradually turned into a game concept and we will playtest various versions during the development of this game.

* 2 teams
* 3 and 4 teams (completely different dynamics)
* blindfolded

# Gamification, ideation and playtesting 

Show&tell intro: educational games and activities made by [Flow Athens](http://www.flowathens.com/en):

* **Mission: water cycle**, a locative game around a dam, riddles to solve, collect water coins, mission to save the water cycle, ancient temple

* **All for one**, inclusive game accessible for disabled people, using only a rope and water bottles, starts simple and builds up on complexity

More case studies: [the Fun Theory](http://www.thefuntheory.com), [Bounden](http://playbounden.com), [Citygories](http://citygoriesgame.com/home.aspx), [X treasure hunts](http://www.xtreasurehunts.com/Pages/01_Main.html) (stealth treasure hunt, walking tour, week-long sailing game), [Hear us Here](http://www.hearushereapp.com/about/) (locative audio-storytelling, showcased at Mozfest)

Discuss: ‘tools’ we use to develop new games

* Change of scale

* Combine concepts/mechanics from different games

* Transfer ideas from board games, from street games, from video games

Pause on each project and ask a couple of questions.

How did Themis solve this?

What were the challenges?

How would you approach this?

Playtesting (and analysing) a couple of games.

# Turning the world into an input device

Interaction between us and a *coded system* happens via **inputs** and **outputs**. We’re very familiar with input devices as buttons on a keyboard, or touch pad. 

We don’t have to limit our imagination to those. We can use simple tech like [makey-makeys](http://makeymakey.com) (QR codes, shortlinks etc.) to turn pretty much anything into an input or output device that is part of our interactive narrative experience. 

### Your turn

**Working in pairs**, you will hack video-gaming experiences by redesigning the controller-player interaction in the physical world. 

Craft functioning prototypes using [makey-makey](http://makeymakey.com).

<!--This challenge will take place at the intersection of the digital and the physical world. We will use digital technology as a creative curiosity amplifier; even water can become a keyboard.
-->

Convert a [one-button single player game](http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/) into a multi player gaming experience within a very short time 20-30mins.

Each group will demonstrate their creations and playtest each other’s.

<!--Teams will make working prototypes for a game controller or an interactive installation with makey-makey, a pre-programmed device that converts anything conductible into a keyboard, using any available crafting materials, like aluminium foil, wires, cardboard etc.-->

We will discuss/demonstrate several game mechanics that could convert a single player game in a multi player activity, such as:

* in-series or in-parallel connections (AND , OR logical gates)

* Passing the signal along the players...

* Collaboratively guiding the game controller, like Bounden and All for One.

* Dramatic change of scale requiring collaboration (imagine two buttons three meters apart).

Then, students could opt to work on a different digital experience, such as another videogame, a twine, an audio narration etc. 

<!--How to turn ideas and narratives into game prototypes.-->

<!--At this point students should try to come up with ideas that relate to their mystery story from term 2. -->

<!--We could give them a set of questions to guide their conceptualisation, then they have to present and maybe prototype them? -->








# Homework

- [ ] TODO

Challenge for students (homework): can you adapt your interactive narrative concept & prototype so that they don’t rely on *makey-makey*?

Flesh out game ideas (at least two) to present in the formative assessment next week.
