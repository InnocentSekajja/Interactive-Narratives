## Week 4 | 7th May | Themis Gkion

### Gamification, ideation and playtesting 

Show&tell intro: educational games and activities made by [Flow Athens](http://www.flowathens.com/en):

* **Mission: water cycle**, a locative game around a dam, riddles to solve, collect water coins, mission to save the water cycle, ancient temple

* **All for one**, inclusive game accessible for disabled people, using only a rope and water bottles, starts simple and builds up on complexity

More case studies: [the Fun Theory](http://www.thefuntheory.com), [Bounden](http://playbounden.com), [Citygories](http://citygoriesgame.com/home.aspx), [X treasure hunts](http://www.xtreasurehunts.com/Pages/01_Main.html) (stealth treasure hunt, walking tour, week-long sailing game), [Hear us Here](http://www.hearushereapp.com/about/) (locative audio-storytelling, showcased at Mozfest)

Discuss: ‘tools’ we use to develop new games

* Change of scale

* Combine concepts/mechanics from different games

* Transfer ideas from board games, from street games, from video games

Pause on each project and ask a couple of questions.

How did Themis solve this?

What were the challenges?

How would you approach this?

Playtesting (and analysing) a couple of games.

* **Thumb Wars** - to experience a few quick iterations of {idea / prototype / playtesting / evaluation} development cycles.

* **Basecamp** - We will discuss how the game idea gradually turned into a game concept and we will playtest various versions during the development of this game.

    * toilet-paper race

    * 2 teams

    * 3 and 4 teams (completely different dynamics)

    * blind

    * dark

### WORKSHOP: from idea to game concept (teams)

Participants will **work in groups **at this point. They will hack video-gaming experiences by redesigning the controller-player interaction in the physical world. They will craft functioning prototypes using [makey-makey](http://makeymakey.com). No programming skills required.

This challenge will take place at the intersection of the digital and the physical world. We will use digital technology as a creative curiosity amplifier; even water can become a keyboard.

Their first challenge could be to convert a simple, one-button single player game into a multi player gaming experience within a very short time 20-30mins.

Each group will demonstrate their creations and playtest each other’s.

Teams will make working prototypes for a game controller or an interactive installation with makey makey, a pre-programmed device that converts anything conductible into a keyboard, using any available crafting materials, like aluminum foil, wires, cardboard etc.

We will discuss/demonstrate several game mechanics that could convert a single player game in a multi player activity, such as:

* in-series or in-parallel connections (AND , OR logical gates)

* Passing the signal along the players…

* Collaboratively guiding the game controller, like Bounden and All for One.

* Dramatic change of scale requiring collaboration (imagine two buttons three meters apart).

Then, the students could opt to work on a different digital experience, such as another videogame, a twine, an audio narration etc. How to turn ideas and narratives into game prototypes.

At this point students should try to come up with ideas that relate to their mystery story from term 2. 

We could give them a set of questions to guide their conceptualisation, then they have to present and maybe prototype them? 

Key concept to hammer in for this session. 

Interaction between us and a *coded system* happens via **inputs** and **outputs**. We’re very familiar with input devices as buttons on a keyboard, or touch pad. We don’t have to limit our imagination to those. We can use simple tech like makey-makeys (QR codes, shortlinks etc.) to turn pretty much anything into an input or output device that is part of our interactive narrative experience. 

### Homework (teams)

Challenge for students (homework): can you adapt your interactive narrative concept & prototype so that they don’t rely on *makey-makey*?

Flesh out game ideas (at least two) to present in the formative assessment next week.
