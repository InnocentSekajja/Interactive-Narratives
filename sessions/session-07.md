## Week 7 | 28th May | MM

### Workshop ideas (teams)

#### Locative games

Mashing the GeoLocation API (native to your browser) with Phaser or Twine (or both!) 

#### Social interfaces

What happens when your body is the controller? When you turn a single-player game into a multi-player one?

Examples: [Bounden](http://playbounden.com), [JS Joust](http://jsjoust.com)

Using Kinect + Scratch (and/or webcam + [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)) hack a game and take it *out of the screen*. We’ll show you some examples and demonstrate a few tricks, then it’s up to you to make your own.

#### Maze game remix

Using Phaser (or similar) *remix* an exploration-based game so that it tells **your** [non]linear story though space. The work may have one or more of the following features:

* Broken time-space continuum

* Non stereotypical kind of fantasy. Can you imagine a fantasy world that is not derived from Tolkien, Asimov, Disney?

* Autobiographical (not necessarily a realistic contemporary setting)

* Based in the Greenwich Peninsula (at any point in history)

### Homework? (teams)
