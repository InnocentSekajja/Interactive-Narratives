## Week 3 | 30th April | Joe Dytrych

### Games with a purpose

Show&tell presentation: what [DrumRoll](http://drumrollhq.com/) does, how and why

- [Jane McGonigal - Gaming can make a better world](http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en#t-464468)
- [Erase All Kittens](https://eraseallkittens.com)

### Story-line ice-breaker

* Line people up on one side of the room. 

* On the other side is the *story line*. 

* One person at a time moves to the story line and says their story line. 

* The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time*) or the end of the story (eg: *And since then, everyone revered Joe*). 

* Everyone can take their spot in between the beginning and the end. 

* Every time someone joins the line, the story loops from the beginning.

### Branching narrative exercise (teams)

We give students the first sentence of a story, their brief is to develop it in a branching narrative. Working in small groups for an hour or so, then present and discuss results with the rest of the class.

Examples and inspirations: 
- [Coming Out Simulator 2014](http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014)
- [Gamer mom](http://adventure.gamism.org/gamer_mom/)

### WORKSHOP: Phaser

[Dialogger](http://j.dytry.ch/stuff/dialogger) (or similar tool that integrates with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/learn)) tutorial and workshop: how to translate a story into JSON

There may be some time left for q&a

Check out [RenPy](http://www.renpy.org), a *visual novel engine*

### Homework (team)

Use a visual novel editor (such as Dialogger or RenPy) to create a multiple choice dialogue with a virtual character. 

Choose one of the following:

* The character is a portrait/caricature of a person you know

* The character is based on the personality types from the Myers-Briggs test (note: pseudo-science)

* The character is a credible depiction of a person affected by mental or behavioral disorder

* Any of the above, but applied to the player’s character

What’s the type of conversation: Interview? Date? Interrogation? Fight? ect.

What’s the power relationship between the two character?

How do the player and NPC feel initially? Friendly? Bored? Aggressive? etc.
