# Games with a purpose

> 10.000 hours: time needed to master something

> Also the time people spend playing games by the time they're 21

Watch this TED talk [Jane McGonigal - Gaming can make a better world](http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en#t-464468)


> Educational games suck

**Games that teach**

- [Erase All Kittens](https://staging.eraseallkittens.com)
- story-driven
- it's first a game, then an educational tool
- you can edit levels by changing their HTML
- introduce concepts gradually

> People don't read tooltips

[Braid](http://braid-game.com) has an interesting way of embedding learning how to use the game interface, at the very beginning of the game. There are for instance illustrations of arrow keys embedded in the game landscape.

# Twine review

* How many different endings are there?
* Is there a preferred path for players/readers to follow, and other paths that will eventually lead to the main path?
* Show us the story map
* Is the player impersonating a character?


[Using variables](session-02.md#variables) in Twine to: 

* expand the possibilities
* avoid repetition 
* make the story more personal

# Branching narratives vs expanding possibilities

From [Nick Case's blog](http://blog.ncase.me/if-games-were-like-game-stories/)

<!--### Exercise

We give students the first sentence of a story, their brief is to develop it in a branching narrative. Working in small groups for an hour or so, then present and discuss results with the rest of the class.-->

Examples and inspirations: 
- [Coming Out Simulator 2014](http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014) and its [source code](https://github.com/ncase/coming-out-simulator-2014)

# Story-line ice-breaker

* Line people up on one side of the room.

* On the other side is the *story line*.

* One person at a time moves to the story line and says their story line.

* The first two people must either choose the beginning (eg: *Once upon a time*) or the end of the story (eg: *And since then, everyone revered Joe*).

* Everyone can take their spot in between the beginning and the end.

* Every time someone joins the line, the story loops from the beginning.

# Homework

Use Twine to create a **multiple choice dialogue** with a virtual character. 

Choose one of the following:

* The character is a portrait/caricature of a person you know

* The character is based on the personality types from the Myers-Briggs test (note: pseudo-science)

* The character is a credible depiction of a person affected by mental or behavioural disorder

* Any of the above, but applied to the player’s character

What’s the type of conversation: Interview? Date? Interrogation? Fight? etc.

What’s the power relationship between the two character?

How do the player and NPC feel initially? Friendly? Bored? Aggressive? etc.
